# swiftqueue
Development of a web app for a test.

Made in PHP, using PostGreSQL as a database.

The Swiftqueue School of High Tech is looking for a better way to manage the courses they can provide to their students; they would like to create an online solution for managing these resources more efficiently.

You are to create a web app for the Swiftqueue school, this application will allow only authenticated users to access the “courses” page. Creation of these users via the app is not required for this project, but it will add extra points if included.
This “courses” page will display all the available courses stored in a DB of your choice at landing. The page can also filter the displayed courses via a course status attribute, meaning if a user wants to see only the active courses they can select the option and make the filter.
The users can perform all CRUD options on the courses and the minimum attributes a course
should have are:
• Start and End Date and time of the course
• Name of the course
• Status of the course
